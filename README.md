# ARD-UI
Maui Website, Maui Blazor Hybrid app, and shared logic between them. The UI will be 98% Web Technology in the Maui Hybrid Application, Maui basically runs our application in a browser, that is how we can share code and libraries like Leaflet in our Mobile and Desktop versions. 

Again, it's important to remember the application itself is almost entirely written in Javascript and running inside a browser, even when running as a full Desktop application, so 98% of our code if not all of it is agnostic to whether we are running on an iPhone, iPad, our website, or as a full blown Windows Desktop.
