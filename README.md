# UI Approach

Technically, ARD is extremely lightweight, fast, and technology-agnostic. It’s built using pure HTML5, modern ECMAScript (JavaScript) classes, and Bootstrap—no heavy frameworks, no build steps, no server requirements. It’s responsive and elegant on phones, tablets, and desktops alike. Because it’s so open and minimal, anyone can contribute—even if you’re new to software. The barrier to entry is low, and the possibilities are wide open.     

1) [Install Visual Code](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q?hl=en-US&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare) (100% Free and Lightweight)
