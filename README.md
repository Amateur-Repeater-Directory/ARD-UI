## UI Approach

Technically, ARD is extremely lightweight, fast, and technology-agnostic. It’s built using pure HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap—no frameworks, no server requirements. It’s responsive and elegant on phones, tablets, and desktops alike. And because it’s so lightweight and open, anyone can contribute—even if you're new to software. The barrier to entry is low, and the possibilities are wide open.
